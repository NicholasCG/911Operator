# 911 Operator
Made by: Aman, Nicholas, Rajmeet, Aditya 


## Problem
The 911 emergency number is one of the most important numbers in the United States. When someone calls 911, they are connected to a dispatcher who will ask them about their emergency. The dispatcher will then send the appropriate emergency services to the caller's location. However, there's a wait time between when the caller calls 911 and when the emergency services arrive. This wait time can be the difference between life and death.

## Solution
The 911 Operator is a way to solve this problem. You can call to this number and it will connect you with our AI voicebot. The voicebot will ask you about your emergency and will send the appropriate emergency services to your location. The voicebot will also give you instructions on how to help the person in need until the emergency services arrive.
